# Switch

The Switch component allows users to toggle between two states, such as on/off or enabled/disabled. It is designed to be accessible and visually appealing, providing a smooth user experience.

<Showcase name="hero" />

## Installation

To install the Switch component, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
qwik-ui add switch
```

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the component code directly into your project.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the Switch component in your application:

```tsx
import { component$, useSignal } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { Switch } from '~/components/ui';

export default component$(() => {
  const checked = useSignal(false);
  return (
    <Switch.Root bind:checked={checked}>
      <Switch.Input />
      <Switch.Label>Toggle Option</Switch.Label>
    </Switch.Root>
  );
});
```
